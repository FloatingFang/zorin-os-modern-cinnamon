# Zorin OS Modern for Cinnamon
An theme made for Cinnamon desktop that reflects a bit of ZorinOS guidelines in UI styling, but since Cinnamon themes are lacking or broken or not able to be used properly

(This is a fork of Zorin-OS-Modern that was seen in gnome-looks, I fixed and made it more looking and correct)

All the right goes to Zorin Group and their design team
